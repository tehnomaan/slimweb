# Slimweb
Slimweb is a lightweight Java web application MVC framework, based on servlets.

Why yet another MVC, when we have popular frameworks already?
Because sometimes, You just don't want the complexity of those popular frameworks.
Instead, You need basic components and a couple of simple HTML-s,
which would be simple to set up, simple to use and have minimal [dependencies](#dependencies).
For large and complex enterprise projects, Slimweb probably lacks features and flexibility.
